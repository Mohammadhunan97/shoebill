# Shoebill Version 2:

* Why create another version of Shoebill? 
* The first framework actually received quite a bit of downloads very quickly, but wasn't maintained and I didn't continue to share it. On a more technical note, it was a heavy scaffolding tool, that was took quite a bit of reading into the source code to understand how to create customizations. This version isn't a scaffolding tool. It's a library built to be lightweight and easily distributable. It also takes advantage of new tools I've learned since making v1, such as yarn, babel and more.
